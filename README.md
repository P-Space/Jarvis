Update
------

The door is no longer using the `DTR` to interface the lock. It now has an `ATTiny85` that is controlling the lock's solenoid. In addition to that a [NeoPixel ring](http://www.adafruit.com/products/1586) was added to signify the presense of the RFID reader and perform a visual effect when a card is accepted. And if that wasn't enough, an [EMIC2](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11711) module has been commissioned the greet the visitors.

You can also find the 3D printed [base for the loudspeaker](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:260836) and [case for the reader and ring](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:260815), at [thingiverse.com](http://www.thingiverse.com/).
